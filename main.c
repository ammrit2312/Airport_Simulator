/*This is an Assignment for Airport Simulation with 3 Runways and keeping in mind that landing is to be given priority that means that 1 strip is reserved for takeoff and one for landing and similarly one is mainly used for landing and only used for takeoff when only 1 plane is landing or no plane is landing that is sitting idle.
 We made an assumption that only 10 flights can request for takeoff and 10 flights can request for landing at a time thus no more flight will be added to queue after 10.
 
 Also, after each iteration of the loop the program pauses for 10 seconds. Moreover our program runs just for 12 iterations.
 
 
 NO INPUT IS TAKEN
 
 (Because of the consideration of being a small airport)
 We have used Linked List to store information of the flights and the flights have been added and deleted using functions.
 Files Associated with this project include:
 1)main.c
 2)functions.c
 3)server.h
 4)makefile.mk
